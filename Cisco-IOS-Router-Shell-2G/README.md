# Cisco IOS Router Shell Gen 2 - modified to create a mock resource structure
*This is not an official Quali shell. It was created for simulation purposes only and should not be used in production environments.*

This shell is based on the Cisco IOS Router Shell (2G). It's "get_inventory" function has been modified to create a mock resource structure of 16 ports. Additional modifications include **ServerName** and **NumberOfPorts** attributes, to be used by the mock autoload process.

**Note:** The number of ports can be changed by editing the shell resource's **NUMBEROFPORTS** attribute.
